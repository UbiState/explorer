Iquidus Explorer - 1.6.1 MIP Patch 1
================

See last Iquidus Explorer readme at
https://github.com/iquidus/explorer

### Introduction

MIP Patch adds a /ext/getutxos route in the explorer API

This is achieved by maintaining a straightforward list of unspent outputs in the Adresses collection items.

This approach is costly in terms of processing time and database storage, but fast in terms of maintaining low query times.

### Requirements

- Explorer database must be fully reconstructed with 
node scripts/sync.js index reindex

- Coin RPC client call "getrawtransaction" must provide "scriptPubKey" info for all outputs.

- More storage space than regular Iquidus explorer. Size may vary on each coin. Do your testing on a staging instance.
